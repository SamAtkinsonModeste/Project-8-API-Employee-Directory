# Treehouse FEWD TechDegree  - Employee Directory Project

This is my eighth project for the [Front End Web Development Techdegree at Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development).

### Description
Communicating with an API to build a prototype for a company of an employee directory of employees to share contact information.

Communicating with APIs allows you to work with microservices and with vast databases to build useful tools and relevant information quickly and easily.

## Overview
  
### About this project

**Using photos and information that the API provides. I will display 12 users, along with some basic information:**
- Image
- First and Last Name
- Email
- City

Users should be able to:

- A mobile-first approach is utilized using min-width properties for media queries.
- Use CSS grid and Flexbox to lay out the main elements (header, search input, main content) on the page.
- Modal to view all contact details for an empolyee

#### Exceeds Requiremnts
- **Exceeds**: Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, 	I will need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. 
- **Exceeds**: Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
